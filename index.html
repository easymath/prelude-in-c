        <span id = 'first'>This song, as its name implies, actually represents a journey through nature with its different sections. It is also called "Journey <b>in the light</b>" because the entire song is in a major key, giving the song a happy and positive feel to it.
        </span>

        <span id = 'last'><br>Journey in the light is a composition with a grand piano as its main instrument, and the violin and cello in the background. The song starts in C with a slow tempo, indicating the start of a journey. Then the song picks up speed and shifts melody to a more energetic and exciting one, showing that the first stage of the journey is full of life and excitement. The song starts to build up and ends with a sharp B arpeggio. The next section is a transitioning section, composed of a variety of key changes, signifying the different awesome things seen during the journey. After going through several key changes the song finally lands in the key of A. Another fast, energetic section leads to the climax of the song, where a series of arpeggios in the key of A are played by the violin. This climax represents the most mesmerizing and breathtaking part of the journey. After the climax is over, the song reverts back to the key of C and its original slow tempo, and the journey ends peacefully.</span>
